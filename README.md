# ProjectEuler
Just working through a few [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems...

**I strongly urge you to try solving the problems at [Project Euler's Archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives) on your own as they can get quite interesting :)**


P.S.
Commenting for code comming soon (I'll do it sooner if your request it to me)!
Not all solutions are completed (ex. #48, I have just started) --> the ones with the 'click to compute' option in the testing html page are the ones that are completed.

*Hope to get to the challenging ones soon...*
